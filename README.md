## Wolf Trail  ✈

_Hi, my name is Fran and I am going to explain my first website, Wolf Trail._

## Index.html 📖

_First we can start with the index.html page which is the main page, in it I briefly explain how it works, it is a website that is aimed at people who like trakking or simply would like to visit Gran Canaria, where I live, there are mainly two sections on the main page where we briefly explain the website and we also give information about the island in case you don't know it on a separate page by clicking on ```Read More```_. 

_You can know more visiting the website of the canary government. [here](http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/turismo/)_

## Routs.html 🗺️

_In the Routes part we give some routes of the island divided into three options, easy, intermediate and difficult, each one with a description of it and important information, at the beginning of the page we explain how to choose the difficulty._

## Contact.html 📌

_Finally, there is the contact page where you can find a section to send a message, this section is not functional because rigth now I don't know Javascript, so is an idea to do it functional in the future and there's also a link to my github and to my twitter._
